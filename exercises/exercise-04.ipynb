    "# Exercise 04 - Due Friday, October 21 at 12pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Objectives*: Gain experience loading a CSV dataset into a database model you define yourself and using SQL to explore its contents. Explore the data by writing and executing a number of SQL queries using common syntax and functions and describing your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading criteria*: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered with SQL queries in the space provided, unless a text answer is requested. Results should be correct, according to the embedded tests. The notebook itself should be completely reproducible; from start to finish, another person should be able to use the same code to obtain the same results as yours.  Note that you will receive no more than partial credit if you do not add text/markdown cells explaining your thinking at each major step in each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deadline*: Friday, October 21, 12pm. Submit your notebook to Blackboard and push it to your GitHub repository.\n",

    "To get a better grasp of the dimensions of the table, let's look at one facility called Cake Fetish. I chose this particular restaurant, because it provides a nice initial look at the dimensions.  As we can see below, each facility name can have multiple facility keys, with different associated location information and nature of business.  Facility names have the same program codes and and program categories.  Each facility key has multiple inspections.  Now we have a better idea of what the columns mean, and what we can expect when running csvstat. It is also worth noting that there are some null values for inspection memo and inpection type.  "

    "Below shows the summary statistics for the columns which provide some insight to the dimensions of the dataset and also the amount of different levels in each of the categorical attributes.  These columns include Facility Name,  Facility Key, Owner Name, Program Category Description, Inspection date, Inspection type, Inspection Description,  Action Description, Result Description, and Violation Description.  Most of the attribute names are intuitive, but this look is helpful to confirm what they represent.  Of these attributes, Program Category Description, Inspection Type, and Violation Description contain null values.  From this output, it seems that the entire Inspection Description column is null, which means it is useless to our analysis. There are 2615 unique Facility Names, but 2835 unique Facility Keys, which means that a Facility Name can have more than one key.  We will look at the details of this in a preceeding cell.  The most frequent facilities to get inspected are Smiths Food and Drug Centers, Inc., Isotopes Park - Ovations, Per EHSII Cecelia Garcia OOB La Reyna Del Sur, Isleta Amphitheater, and Echo Inc.  There are slighlty less levels for Owner Names, which we would expect.  Therefore Owners can own multiple facilities.  There are 24 different program categories, most of which are classified as \"Food Service Establishment.\"  This dataset is from 2010, and is updated daily as per the metadata.  This particular set of restaurant inspections ranges from 7/1/2009 through 6/30/2010.  As per the inspection description types, there are 15 different types.  From the 5 most frequent, it is seen that some levels of this attribute are upper case and some are mixed case.  This is important to keep in mind when combining data and could present an issue going forward.  As expected, most inpsections are \"Routine.\"  There are 8 unique values for Action Description.  Most are approved or ungraded.  A very small amount seem to be considered \"Unsatisfactory.\"  The next column is Result Description.  The difference between this column and the action column is intuitive--one shows the results and one shows the action.  From the differences in counts, it is shown that more are found to be in compliance than actually are approved in result of the inspection. Also, more are deemed unsatisfactory than result in a \"Downgrade\" from the inspection. For the Violation Description column, there are 70 unique values.  Most violations are classified as \"additional comments\" which may not be greatly helpful in our analysis.\n"

    "The statistics for the remaining fields are shown in the output below.   Columns which contain null values are site address, Nature of Business, address information, phone number, violation codes, and inspection memo all contain null values.  Like Inspection Description, the entire column is null, so it is useless in analysis. Other columns which are useless are City and State, since this is Albuquerque only data.  It seems that there is some sort of data issue with the state field anyway.  There are 48 different zip codes for the inspection locations in this dataset. There are 1892 unique owner values, which is slightly above the number of unique owner names.  Nature of Business category is similar to the Program Category Description, but has more levels.  We will look at this in a few cells.  Many of the facilities being inspected are located on Central Street.  None of the keys or codes have null values besides violation code. The levels generally match the corresponding descriptions.  Serial Number is a unique ID for inspection daily activity. It counts the number of inspections each Owner_ID taking into account if there are multiple inspections in one day.  It should be viewed at the Owner_ID and Inspection_Date level."

Additionally, there are cases when the same store has multiple Facility Names with a string of numbers attached.

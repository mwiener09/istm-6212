Hi Lingyao!

Great job with project 1! I had no issue stepping through your program in datanotebook.org and our answers matched for the majority of questions.

For question 1, we approached this problem in slightly different ways, both of which obtained the same result. I like your way, it seems more efficient and intuitive. I learned about the -o option in grep from your answer.

For questions 2 & 3 , we used the same process and obtained the same result.  After reviewing your python files, I thought that our code was succinct and effective.  You removed the punctuation in the same way that I did, using the re package.

For the extra credit, we used the same approach.  Counts are pretty close for both of our approaches (~1 off).

My only other minor/organization-type feedback would be maybe to include a bit more commenting and markdown text boxes to narrate your process a bit more clearly.  Also, I would keep your commenting consistent using either all markdown boxes  or all within the code.  

Great work!

Thanks,
Marissa
